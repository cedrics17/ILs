Package Scripts to Submit Ionic Liquids studies in LAMMPS
After running the replica exchange simulations and considering that LAMMPS dumps the coordinates following the trajectory and not the temperature, some additional processing has to be done using the reorder_remd_traj.py script available in lammps github replica package. 

### This Package assumes that the replica exchange was done and processed such as the dump files are temperature based and not trajectory based.
